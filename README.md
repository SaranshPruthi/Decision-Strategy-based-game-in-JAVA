# Decision-Strategy-based-game-in-JAVA
This decision based terminal game has been made using JAVA by implementing Object Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts in it.

The game has six different locations and the player is asked to choose one of the 6 locations at the start of the game and then asked a short descriptive type location based question and if the player wins that location then the player proceeds to choose one of the remaining 5 locations with the same number of lives as the start (=3) and the game continues until and unless the player finishes all the stages with lives > 0 and eventually wins.
If at any stage the player loses, one life is deducted and the player has to choose between one of the two side/life recovery games i.e. tic tac toe OR dice roll in order to recover from the loss of one life and reach back the location choosing stage.

The folder named location defines all the 6 locations (based on BITS Pilani K.K Birla Goa campus) of the game and the file Game.java is the main game file of this project.
